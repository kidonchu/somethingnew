It's around that time of the year. Zombies arise from the dead, vampires wake up from their long
dream in coffins, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/" target="_blank">Stranger
Things</a> start to happen in a house, deep in the forest.

Yes, it's **Halloween!**

Sadly, I did not celebrate Halloweens to the fullest. I often walked around without any costume, watching
what others had become. But nothing more than that. This year, I want to try something different,
*something new*. Instead of being an observer, I want to enjoy the spirit of Halloween as much as
possible; all starting with, Pumpkin Carving!

## Getting ready

What do I need to carve a pumpkin?

- **Pumpkin**: Pretty one with consistent color all around
- **Carving knives**
- **Lights**: To put in the carved pumpkin. I'm thinking... Christmas lights?
- **Favorite stencil**: Should I go with beginner level, traditional scary face carving?

## D-Day

The day has come and Now is the time. Let's do pumpkin carving!

I have to admit, the day didn't start too well. We had an appointment for Skylar's 9-month checkup.
I got up at around 7:30am when Skylar woke up, yet again with a smile that pauses the moment
and a smile that makes me hopelessly stare at.

By the time we walked out of the Skylar's doctor's office, I started to feel extremely tired as if
all those fatigue that I accumulated over the week finally decided to bring me down. 

However, there is nothing good afternoon nap can't do. After waking up from the nap, I was ready to
rock with my pumpkins. Few emotions I had during carving pumpkins that I haven't felt for awhile
were,

- Fully focusing on crafting something
- Building something from the ground and achieving an output

## Party is over
