The week started as normal. Just another Monday, feeling not too excited, with this irritating
thought in my head that had been lingering for a while.

> Am I having fun with my life?

I can go on and on about how happy I am with my lovely wife and daughter. But when the question
becomes whether I am having fun, my answer is "I don't know".

So, I decided to start a journal with a theme, **SOMETHING NEW**. This will be the journal of
my attempt to try something new every other week, or every week if my life permits. I have no idea
what I would want to try in the next few weeks but I'm sure something will come up.
