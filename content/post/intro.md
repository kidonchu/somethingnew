## Having Fun?

The week started as normal. Just another Monday, feeling not too excited, with this irritating
thought in my head that had been lingering for a while.

> Am I having fun with my life?

I can go on and on about how happy I am with my lovely wife and daughter. But when the question
becomes whether I am having fun, my answer is "I don't know".

Working on my side projects is fun, but it has its limit. Often times, when I come home, I don't
even turn on my laptop because of the exhaustion from the work. It's not that the programming is not
fun; rather, my brain just gets tired out at the end of the day and no longer wants to deal with any
digital stuff.

So, to freshen up, I decided to start a journal with a theme, **SOMETHING NEW**. This will be the journal of
my attempts to try something new every other week, or every week if my life permits. I have no idea
what I would want to try in the next few weeks but I'm sure something will come up and I will have
plenty in my [TODO](/todo) list.

### Definition of *Something New*

Here are my definitions of *Something New*.

- Things I've never tried, no matter how trivial they are
- Things I've tried, but forgotten how I felt while doing them

Execution time is not a concern. It can be an one-day activity or something that requires weeks of
commitments.

After writing all these, this idea of **Something New** almost sounds like a bucket list with one
more factor added to it: emotions and feelings. *New* in a sense that "this *something* feels new".
This, of course, includes something I have never tried because I don't know the feeling of something
I've never done before.

Hopefully I can continue acting on this idea and bring fresh feelings to my life.
